‚úÖ Definition (Simple Words)
useContext is a React hook that allows a component to access shared data (context) without 
having to pass props manually through every level of the component tree.

In short:

It gives global-like state access across components.
Solves the problem of ‚Äúprop drilling‚Äù.

/*---
üîç Why useContext? (Behind the scenes)

Normally in React, data flows top-down via props.
But if deeply nested components need the same data (e.g. a user object), 
passing props manually through each level is repetitive and error-prone ‚Äî this is called prop drilling.
useContext + React.createContext() lets you share such values directly, avoiding this mess.

// How to use useContext
// step1: Create the context
import {createContext, useState} from 'react'

export const ThemeContext = createContext()

// step2: Provide the context with value
const [theme, setTheme] = useState()

<ThemeContext.Provider value={{theme, setTheme}}>
    <App />
</ThemeContext.Provider>

// step3: Consume the context
import { useContext } from "react";
import { ThemeContext } from "./ThemeContext";

const Component = () => {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <div className={`theme-${theme}`}>Hello!</div>;
};

Flow Summary

1. createContext()
‚Üì
2. <Provider value={data}>
‚Üì
3. useContext(SomeContext) inside any component

‚ùì Common Interview Questions
What problem does useContext solve?

It solves prop drilling by giving components direct access to shared data.

Does useContext cause re-renders?

Yes. If the context value changes, all components using that context will re-render.

How is useContext different from Redux or Zustand?

useContext is for static/shared state. Redux/Zustand are better for complex state logic, actions, and performance optimizations.

/*----
‚ÄúuseContext is a great way to access global state like auth or theme without drilling props through every level. 
But we must be careful ‚Äî if the value changes, it re-renders all consumers, 
so it's not great for high-frequency updates like typing state. In such cases, 
using state management tools like Redux or Zustand is more appropriate.‚Äù
